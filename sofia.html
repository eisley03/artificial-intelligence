        Hanson Robotics released a humanoid in 2016 that shocked the world. 
        <a href="https://www.nationalgeographic.com/photography/article/sophia-robot-artificial-intelligence-science">Newspapers, articles, and magazines took to the world blasting the idea that “Sophia” is the next generation of humanoids.</a>
        Hanson Robotics is a company based in Hong Kong, China. 
        They kept the Sophia project under wraps for years. 
        The genius mind behind this <i>milestone</i> in artificial intelligence is a Disney Imagineer, David Hanson. 
        Hanson wanted to create a humanoid capable of mimicking human facial expressions and social behaviors. 
        Sophia combines human-like features and programming to “depict the future of AI and robotics”. 
        This is done through the flexible rubber skin that allows it to change expressions quicker than ever before. 
        The robot is capable of reading human posture to mimic the formality of any situation. 
        It, however, is not able to use AGI, or artificial general intelligence, to communicate with humans. 
        It uses pre-written responses and words to create sentences.

        This robot has created some controversy in the last few years. 
        The argument of whether a robot should be considered a citizen has come into play. 
        Sophia is the “first robot citizen”, and she is “first robot Innovation Ambassador for the United Nations Development Program”. 
        Hanson has tried to develop software that will allow the robot to contribute to the needs of the human race. 
        Sophia will have the potential to understand the needs of a user to entertain and service. 
        This will be accomplished through a project called the “Loving AI” project. 
        This project is a sign of the future of AI and how it will continue to develop and changes throughout the upcoming years.
