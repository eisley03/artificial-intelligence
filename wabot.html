<p>
    In the 1970s, the world of artificial intelligence continued to flourish. 
    The programming languages advanced and the availability of computers increased leaving a perfect storm for technology advances. 
    In 1970, the WABOT-1 was beginning to be developed at the Waseda University in Japan. 
    The WABOT-1 was one of the first successful cases of artificial intelligence with human capabilities. 
    The robot was able to extend its limbs and grip objects with the capability to move them. 
    They also gave the robot the ability to have semi-functioning sensory abilities. 
    The one downfall of this device was the speed at which it was able to carry out its functions. 
    One WABOT-1 step would take at least 45 seconds to complete which made this robot non-functional in assisting humans. 
    This <i>milestone</i> paved the way to create a helpful “personal” robot for the masses.

        The WABOT-2 was created six years later. 
        This robot had the capability of reading sheet music, talking to a human, and even singing alongside a human. 
        These two humanoids were the start of modern artificial intelligence. 
        During this time period the classic film Star Wars by George Lucas. 
        The creation of Star Wars highlighted the possibility of robots with human functions and human thoughts. 
        The film featured two humanoid robots that made the modern world of artificial intelligence a reality to the masses. 
        Once the reality of robots was introduced to the public the film industry took the concept and ran with it. 
        There were many films that came after the original Star Wars that featured intelligent robotics.
