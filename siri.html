    <h3 class="orange">Siri & Her Future</h3>
    <p> 
        In 2010, Siri was introduced to the public at a technology conference. 
        <a href="https://www.computerworld.com/article/3263425/hey-siri-give-me-a-product-development-road-map-for-ai.html">Siri was said to be a “humble personal assistant”.</a> 
        This assistant was capable of listening to human speech, in English, and responding to it by typing its messages on a screen. 
        It came back with fast, witty answers that stunned the crowd of onlookers. 
        This changed in 2011 when Apple decided to buy Siri Inc. and turn it into a satellite of their existing company. 
        Apple decided to communicate in many languages to form an application that could be used worldwide. 
        Apple provided Siri with a way to communicate verbally with its user instead of only through text. 
        They then received funding from the government to continue improving their “personal assistant”. 
        During its development, Apple wanted Siri to be able to use many types of search engines to compare responses from each one.
        This feature would ensure the user received the best answer to their inquiry. 
        Apple also made sure Siri was compatible with the other services they provided through their phones. 
        Siri, for example, can connect with their Maps application to bring users to a destination of their choosing. 
        Apple wanted to bring Siri into the realm of being a personal assistant. 
        They wanted to allow it to read people's moods and emotions to better understand what they needed or wanted to hear. 
        For example, if a flight had been canceled or delayed Siri would be able to detect the user’s distress and explore alternate flight options. 
        This idea was put to rest in the early 2000s but shows what the future may hold for Apple products.
