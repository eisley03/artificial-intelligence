        <h3 class="green">Kismet the Robot</h3>
        <p>
            Throughout the 1990s there were many new types of programming languages created that made advances in computer technology easier. 
            This trend continued into the 2000s as many researchers decided to focus on AI technology. 
            At MIT, there was a new technology brewing. 
            Kismet, an artificially intelligent robot, was under development by MIT’s Professor Cynthia Breazeal. 
            Kismet is the first robot that could use expressive modes of communication. 
            This robot proved that humanoids could interact and socialize alongside humans.
            The significance of this interaction showed that robots of all kinds could play a part in our daily lives. 
            Kismet had software and modifications that allowed it to perceptualize human interactions. 
            It could hear and respond to human speech, see and respond to human facial expressions, and watch and follow human movements. 
            It has swivel capabilities in its neck that allow movement in a certain degree of motion. 
            The Kismet can react to human speech through its auditory device which is picked up through a microphone given to the “caregiver”. 
            The Kismet had many cameras that allowed it to react and respond to many types of human interactions. 
            When there is not a human or toy interacting with the Kismet it is able to show sadness and present that it wants to play. 
            The concept of Kismet was applied to furbies. 
            <a href="https://sherryturkle.mit.edu/sites/default/files/images/ST_First%20Encounters%20with%20Kismet.pdf">Furbies were a popular early 2000s toy with almost the same capabilities as Kismet.</a> 
            Kismet was more advanced, but furbies were sold to the mass market towards children. 
            These toys become popular for their need-based play. 
            Children loved nurturing these creepy toys and these became one of the first instances of AI introduced on a worldwide scale.
